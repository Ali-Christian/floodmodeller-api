Python resources
----------------------
There is a huge amount of resources for learning python online, many of which are completely free. For a lot of things, the quickest
way to solve a problem is to simply google it, and chances are there will be existing discussions and solutions for the exact problem. 

For a great place to start learning python, we'd recommend the following (all of which are free!):

- `W3 Schools python tutorial <https://www.w3schools.com/python/>`_ - A simple, and well designed introduction to Python
- `RealPython's first steps <https://realpython.com/python-first-steps/>`_ - Another good introduction to Python
- `CS50's Introduction to Computer Science <https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x>`_ - Not python-specific, but an excellent 
  course from Havard University introducing the fundamental concepts of computer science and programming.
  
User Feedback
----------------------
Flood Modeller Python API is still in its early stages of development, and as such, user feedback is incredibly
valuable to help us improve the functionality and usability of the package. Please `get in touch with the Flood Modeller team <https://www.floodmodeller.com/contact>`_.
