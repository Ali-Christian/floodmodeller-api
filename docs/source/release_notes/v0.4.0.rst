Bug fixes
--------------
- Fixed `issue <https://github.com/People-Places-Solutions/floodmodeller-api/issues/3>`_ that required setting ``ied_filepath = None`` to create a blank IED file. Now it can be done by simply calling ``IED()``
- Fixed `issue <https://github.com/People-Places-Solutions/floodmodeller-api/issues/4>`_ in IEF class where it would fail when attempting to save an IEF after changing the case of an attribute. Now if you have an IEF with
  an attribute 'Title=...' and you set ``ief.title = ...`` the updated ief file will match the lower case used in ``title``.
