What's new in 0.3.13 (May 2022)
************************************

This page details the changes for version 0.3.13 of Flood Modeller Python API

New features
--------------
- BLOCKAGE added as a supported unit.
- CULVERT (Inlet and Outlet loss) added as a supported unit

Updates
--------------
- Added support for 'DATES' in timeseries tables


Bug fixes
--------------
- Fixed `issue <https://github.com/People-Places-Solutions/floodmodeller-api/issues/3>`_ that required setting ``ied_filepath = None`` to create a blank IED file. Now it can be done by simply calling ``IED()``
- Fixed `issue <https://github.com/People-Places-Solutions/floodmodeller-api/issues/4>`_ in IEF class where it would fail when attempting to save an IEF after changing the case of an attribute. Now if you have an IEF with
  an attribute 'Title=...' and you set ``ief.title = ...`` the updated ief file will match the lower case used in ``title``.
- Fixed issue on orifice unit where shape not defined in .dat.
- Allow 'timeunit' attribute to be set as number (which is used for user defined time multiplier)
