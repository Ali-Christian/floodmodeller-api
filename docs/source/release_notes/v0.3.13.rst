Bug fixes
--------------
- Fixed issue that required setting ``ied_filepath = None`` to create a blank IED file. Now it can be done by simply calling ``IED()``
- Fixed issue in IEF class where it would fail when attempting to save an IEF after changing the case of an attribute. Now if you have an IEF with
an attribute 'Title=...' and you set ``ief.title = ...`` the updated ief file will match the lower case used in ``title``.
